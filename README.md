Hello! If you've stumbled upon this repository, you're probably lost... In any case, welcome!

I wanted to try out Jupyter notebooks, and figured I'd dip my toe in the LLM pool. I'm working my way through Andrej Karpathy's (truly excellent) YouTube series, [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)

I might update this notebook with model optimizations as I build them out? We'll see. 

If you're interested in learning more about neural networks, I highly recommend checking out Andrej's YouTube channel, where he breaks things down to a very, very consumable level (even for a product dude like myself).

- Jupyter noteboook, requires PyTorch
- A very meek neural network capable of generating single words, implemented here to generate some new prescription drug names
- Uses the FDA Orangebook as a training data set, found here: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/orange-book-data-files
