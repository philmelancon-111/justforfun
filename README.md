Hello! If you've stumbled upon this repository, you're probably lost... In any case, welcome!

This is a catch-all bucket of random coding stuff I choose to upload from my local machine. Mostly Python.

I guess I'll leave descriptions here as I upload things? Not sure how this is supposed to work.

**rx_drug_name_generator**
- Jupyter noteboook, requires PyTorch
- A very meek neural network capable of generating single words, implemented here to generate some new prescription drug names
- Uses the FDA Orangebook as a training data set, found here: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/orange-book-data-files
- Follows steps outlined in Andrej Karpathy's (truly excellent) YouTube series, Neural Networks: Zero to Hero: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ
